# Fake-News-Detection (Using Machine Learning)

One of the biggest issues that we face today is the spread of false information, especially on online social networks. This poses a significant threat to the trustworthiness of information available online and consequently, to society itself.

The proposed system aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for preprocessing and analyzing text data to extract valuable insights. The process begins by gathering unstructured text data from various sources such as social media, news articles, and research papers. This data undergoes thorough preprocessing to ensure quality and consistency, involving tasks such as noise removal, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and normalization.

 # Key components of the system include:

 # 1) Data Preprocessing:
   Techniques like noise removal, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and normalization are used to prepare the text data.

 # 2) Feature Extraction:
   The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method is used to assign weights to words based on their frequency and rarity, capturing the significance of words in the text data.

 # 3) Machine Learning Models:
   Multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, gradient boosting, and random forest, are implemented to analyze the preprocessed text data.
